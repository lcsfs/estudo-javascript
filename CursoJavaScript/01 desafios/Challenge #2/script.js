/* Coding Challenge #2
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!" */

const massMark = 78;
const heightMark = 1.69;
const massJohn = 95;
const heightJohn = 1.88;

const markBMI = massMark / heightMark ** 2;
const johnBMI = massJohn / heightJohn ** 2;

if (markBMI > johnBMI) {
  console.log(`Mark's BMI (${markBMI.toFixed(2)}) is higher than John's (${johnBMI.toFixed(2)})!`);
} else {
  console.log(`John's BMI (${johnBMI.toFixed(2)}) is higher than Mark's (${markBMI.toFixed(2)})!`);
}
